# linkedLists
A linked list is a linear data structure used in computer science to organize and store data. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation. Instead, each element, called a node, contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The last node typically points to null, indicating the end of the list.
